# [Biomolecule-AL-Decipher] Deciphering Key Factors of Active LearningPerformance in Biomolecular Design

This repository hosts the official code and datasets for the research paper *Deciphering Key Factors of Active Learning Performance in Biomolecular Design*.

### Core Focus
We systematically investigate the key factors of Active Learning (AL) performance in biomolecular design, and provide a comprehensive benchmark for uncertainty quantification (UQ) algorithms and AL sampling strategies. Our findings reveal the critical factors influencing AL-based fitness optimization efficiency, offering practical guidance for genetic engineering applications.

### Key Outcomes
- Demonstrated the reliability and robustness of ensemble-based UQ algorithms
- Evaluated representative existing AL sampling strategies 
- Identified significant factors determining optimization efficiency (initial settings, distribution sparsity, and sequence similarity)
- Proposed two quantifiable metrics to measure the key influencing factors
